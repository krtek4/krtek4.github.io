In 2011, my wife, or fiancee at that time, undertook the "Shaved Head challenge":http://www.tetesrasees.com/Participant.aspx?id=19972. She needed some help to raise funds, so I proposed to built a website to let other people know about her project.

The shaving occurred the 9th june and her hair are now slowly growing again ;)

The website is not online anymore since the event took place in 2011. However, we launched a similar event in switzerland now that we've return here : "CHauve pour la bonne cause":http://chauvepourlabonnecause.ch
