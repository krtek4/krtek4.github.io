After the obtention of my Bachelor degree, the professor who followed my diploma work proposed to hire me to work in the "GAPS Institute":http://gaps.heig-vd.ch at the the School of Business and Engineering Vaud ("HEIG-VD":http://www.heig-vd.ch), now part of the University of Applied Sciences of western Switzerland ("HES-SO":http://www.hes-so.ch).

The institute is tasked with the development and maintenance of the complete planification system used by the HEIG-VD and the master part of the HES-SO. The project is separated in two parts : a web application and a rich client. Both parts access to data stored in a PostgreSQL database.

The web application is entirely written in PHP. It is used by the students and professor to consult their schedule and grades, manage the presence list and various other means. The rich client is used by the board of education to planify the school curicula.
