Alongside [CHauve pour la bonne cause](http://gilles.crettenand.info/portfolio/chauvepourlabonnecause), MoistaCHe is an event we created to raise funds to develop cancer awareness.

The event war run for two years but was now discontinued since Movember is also present in Switzerland. Thus the website is not online anymore.
