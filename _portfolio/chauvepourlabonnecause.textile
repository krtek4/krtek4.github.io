"CHauve pour la bonne cause":http://chauvepourlabonnecause.ch is an event were people can shave their heads in order to raise funds that are then distributed to various projects helping people having cancer.

My wife and I created created this project in 2011 after she took part in the Shaved Head Challenge in Quebec. We immediately wanted to do something similar in switzerland.

All the relevant information can be found on "the official web page":http://chauvepourlabonnecause.ch.

During the years, the site has several redesign, the new one being probably the most accomplished.
