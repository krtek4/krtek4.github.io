As part of my diploma I had to do a bachelor project. It consists of a six month work on a subject followed by a professor. I decided to develop a database schema editor for [MADS](http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/99113. I was followed by Pier Donini, one of the co-writer of the first "MADS specification)

I worked with a friend on this project. I wrote the GUI, while my colleague wrote a schema to SQL translator.

The possibility to also edit UML was added during the six month and a translator MADS <-> UML also exists. This functionnality is however really buggy.

The editor was supposed to be developed further after my graduation, but sadly no funds were found. You can find the actual source code on Google Code : [mads-designer](http://code.google.com/p/mads-designer/).
